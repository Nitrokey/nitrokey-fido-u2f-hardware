Nitrokey FIDO U2F Hardware
===================

Nitrokey FIDO U2F is based on U2F Zero, an open source, open hardware U2F token for 2 factor authentication.  It is implemented securely.  It works with Google accounts, Github, Duo, and anything else supporting U2F.  The latest version uses key derivation and has no limit on registrations.

Here are the hardware files provided. Nitrokey's device differs in using a touch button instead of a regular one, as well as using smaller PCB.
Firmware files are provided [here](https://github.com/Nitrokey/nitrokey-fido-u2f-firmware).
